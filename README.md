# 01Blog

## Overview

In this project, you will build a social blogging platform called **01Blog**, where students can share their learning experiences, discoveries, and progress throughout their journey. Users can interact with each otherâ€™s content, follow one another, and engage in meaningful discussions.

You will develop this platform as a fullstack application, using **Java Spring Boot** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend. The project covers essential features such as REST API development, user authentication, media handling, and more.

### Key Features:

* User registration and secure login
* Role-based access control (User vs Admin)
* Media uploads (Images/Video)
* Real-time post interactions (Likes/Comments)
* Admin panel for content moderation

## Clean Architecture

**Clean Architecture** is a software design philosophy that emphasizes separation of concerns, testability, and scalability. It structures your application into layers, each with a specific responsibility, making it easier to maintain and extend.

* **Entities**: Core business logic, independent of any external dependencies.
* **Use Cases**: Application-specific business rules.
* **Interface Adapters**: Converts data from external sources into a format that can be understood by the use cases and entities.
* **Frameworks & Drivers**: External agents such as databases, web frameworks, or UI components.
