## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

01Blog follows **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring maintainability, testability, and scalability through clear separation of concerns.

![Clean Architecture Diagram](./docs/assets/clean_architecture.png)

### Architecture Layers

1. **Entities** - Core business logic, independent of external dependencies
2. **Use Cases** - Application-specific business rules and workflows
3. **Interface Adapters** - Data transformation layer between external sources and business logic
4. **Frameworks & Drivers** - External integrations (database, web framework, UI)

This architectural approach provides:
- Independence from frameworks and external tools
- Highly testable business logic
- Flexibility to swap implementations
- Clear dependency flow (inward only)
