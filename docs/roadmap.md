Looking at your project structure and the requirements, I can see you've implemented clean architecture well with proper separation of concerns. Your modular approach with user, post, admin, and shared modules is solid.

For the most effective development approach, I recommend the **Backend-First with Mid-Development Frontend Testing** strategy:

## Recommended Development Flow

### Phase 1: Complete Core Backend APIs (Week 1-2)
**Focus on completing all essential CRUD operations:**

1. **User Module** (already done ✓)
   - Registration/Login ✓
   - User profile management
   - User subscription system

2. **Post Module** (partially done)
   - Complete CRUD operations for posts
   - Media upload functionality 
   - Comments and likes system

3. **Notification Module**
   - Basic notification creation/retrieval

**Why this approach:**
- You get a complete, testable API surface
- Can validate your clean architecture decisions
- Database relationships are fully established
- Easier to spot design issues early

### Phase 2: Basic Frontend Integration (Week 3)
**Create minimal frontend to test backend:**

```
frontend/src/app/
├── core/
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── auth.service.ts
│   │   ├── api.service.ts
│   │   └── post.service.ts
│   └── models/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── login/
│   │   └── register/
│   └── posts/
│       ├── post-list/
│       └── post-form/
└── shared/
    └── components/
```

**Build only:**
- Login/Register forms
- Basic post listing
- Simple post creation form

**Benefits:**
- Tests your API contracts
- Validates JSON responses
- Identifies missing endpoints
- Confirms authentication flow

### Phase 3: Complete Backend Features (Week 4-5)
**Add remaining complex features:**

4. **Report Module**
   - User reporting system
   - Admin report management

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Real-time notifications (WebSocket)
   - Media storage optimization
   - Advanced query operations

### Phase 4: Full Frontend Development (Week 6-8)
**Build complete user interface:**
- Responsive design with Angular Material
- All user interactions
- Admin dashboard
- Real-time features

## Why This Approach Works Best

### Advantages:
1. **Early Validation** - Catch architectural issues before too much frontend work
2. **Clear Contracts** - API endpoints are well-defined before frontend development
3. **Parallel Development** - Can work on complex backend features while having basic frontend
4. **Reduced Debugging** - Separate backend/frontend issues clearly
5. **Portfolio Value** - Shows you can build complete, testable APIs

### Implementation Priority:

**High Priority (Must Complete First):**
```java
// These should be fully working before frontend
- User authentication & authorization
- Post CRUD with media upload
- User subscriptions
- Basic notifications
```

**Medium Priority (Can develop with basic frontend):**
```java
// These can be added while building frontend
- Comments and likes
- User reporting
- Admin moderation tools
```

**Low Priority (Polish features):**
```java
// These are enhancement features
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Advanced search/filtering
- Analytics dashboard
```

## Practical Next Steps:

1. **Complete Post Module Backend** (2-3 days)
   - Finish media upload
   - Add comments/likes endpoints
   - Test with Postman/curl

2. **Add Subscription System** (1-2 days)
   - User follow/unfollow
   - Feed generation logic

3. **Build Minimal Frontend** (2-3 days)
   - Authentication pages
   - Basic post feed
   - Post creation form

4. **Test Integration** (1 day)
   - End-to-end API testing
   - Fix any contract issues

This approach gives you working software early while maintaining code quality and architectural integrity. You'll have a solid foundation to build upon and can demonstrate progress at each phase.
