This architecture is designed specifically for your transition from React/Next.js to Angular while maintaining the clean separation you've established in your backend.
Key advantages for you:
Familiar Patterns:

Component-based like React
Feature modules similar to Next.js app structure
Service layer matches your backend ports
Clear separation of concerns

Angular-Specific Benefits:

Built-in dependency injection (better than prop drilling)
RxJS for reactive data (more powerful than useState)
TypeScript-first (type safety everywhere)
Angular Material for consistent UI

Quick Start Strategy:

Week 1: Auth module only - get comfortable with Angular basics
Week 2: Posts list and detail - learn data flow
Week 3: Post creation with media upload - handle forms
Week 4+: Add remaining features with confidence
